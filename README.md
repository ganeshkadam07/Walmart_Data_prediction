Introduction
The ability to predict sales accurately is crucial for retailers like Walmart as it helps in inventory management, resource allocation, and decision making. In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that can forecast sales for individual Walmart stores using historical sales data and other relevant features.

Data
The dataset used in this project is the historical sales data of Walmart stores. The dataset contains the following features:

Store: Store number
Date: Date of the sales record
Sales: Weekly sales for a particular store
Holiday: Whether the week is a holiday week or not
Temperature: Average temperature in the region
Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the region
CPI: Consumer Price Index
Unemployment: Unemployment rate in the region
IsHoliday: Whether the week contains a holiday or not
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used for model development and training, while the testing set is used for evaluating the performance of the trained model.

Data Exploration
Before developing the model, it is important to explore and analyze the data. The data exploration phase involves understanding the distribution of the features, identifying missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are applied to gain insights into the data.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a predictive model. It involves transforming the raw data into a format suitable for the machine learning algorithm. This step may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling numerical features, and creating new features from existing ones.

Model Development
For sales prediction, various machine learning algorithms can be employed, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting methods. In this project, we will develop a regression model to predict sales based on the selected features. The model will be trained on the training dataset and tuned using cross-validation techniques.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the developed model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). These metrics help assess the accuracy and generalization capability of the model.

Usage
